Well hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). 
My work revolves around the intersection of Machine Learning, Data Mining and Social Science. My research draws inspiration
from models tackling generalization and distributional shifts. I am also interested in community structures. 

Prior to this, my Masters work revolved around Geospatial Big Data at ASU's [DataSys](https://datasystemslab.engineering.asu.edu/) Lab.
My Masters thesis proposes an Explanation Framework for Mobility Datasets.

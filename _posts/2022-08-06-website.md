Since my focus has shifted, I have decided to put down the old website. The old blog mainly consisted of 
posts about software development and random things I was doing. I had not updated it in several years since
my focus had shifted more towards my PhD studies. This new website will follow suit.

For any information about the old content, please feel free to reach out to me.
